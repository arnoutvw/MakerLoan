# MakerLoan
 
 A project for a course in object oriented programming. Its purpose is purely educational, and is practically useless for anything else. It is supposed to be an application to manage loans of items, but is fundamentally inadequate for the job. 
 
 This program simply provides a way to create and list objects and saving them to serialized files. It is an exercise in object creation, abstraction, encapsulation and GUI building. Expect a lot of bad coding practices and ~~scarce~~ non-existent commenting and documentation.
